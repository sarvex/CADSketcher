There's an initial tagging system in place to tag entities as dirty however this is currently still disabled by default.</p> <p>NOTE: In order to draw anything a draw handler has to be registered on the viewport type.

You can use the inspect module to get more info like the signature of a function: <pre><code>import inspect\ninspect.signature(sys.addEqual)\n</code></pre></p> <p>The solver data isn't persistent, so whenever the solver is triggered it will create a new \"py_slvs.slvs.System\" object.Then the solver will go through the relevant entities and call their create_slvs_data method and pass the system object to it. Same applies to the constraints.</p> <p>The create_slvs_data has to return the solver handles of the elements it adds to the solver. This is later used to check which constraints have failed to solve.</p> <p>When the solver was successful it will again go through all the entities and call their update_from_slvs methods to update the blender data from the solver system.</p>"},{"location":"code_docs/#converter","title":"Converter","text":"<p>Currently there is only one native converter implemented, namely the BezierConverter defined in converters.py.
